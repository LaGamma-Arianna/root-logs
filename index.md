The terminal is open.

Welcome to **Root-Logs** — my personal corner of the internet where I track my journey through cybersecurity training, TryHackMe labs, and certification prep.

On this blog, I’ll be documenting my progress through the TryHackMe SOC Level 1 Pathway, breaking down what I learned from the rooms. Along the way, I’ll dive into tools that are essential for forensic analysis — like Wireshark, Autopsy, The Sleuth Kit (TSK), and ExifTool — and share how I’m using them in real-world scenarios.

I'll also be exploring root cause analysis techniques and developing an understanding of how threats are detected, investigated, and mitigated.

Since I recently passed the CompTIA Security+ exam, I’ll be putting together study guides, checklists, and book reviews to help others prepping for it. And as I move into studying for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, I’ll continue sharing insights and resources I find helpful.

Through all of this, Root-Logs is where I’ll reflect on what I’m learning, how I’m growing, and how I’m building hands-on confidence in the cybersecurity world.

Logs are live. Follow the trace if you're digging into cyber too.
