# How I Caught a Phishing Email ‚Äî and What It Taught Me About Email Security

The other day, I caught a phishing email right in my inbox.

It wasn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôd seen suspicious messages, but this one felt different. It posed as a voicemail notification from "Microsoft Outlook," complete with the familiar branding and a large blue button:

> **"Preview or Download Voice Message"**

For a moment, it looked believable. But experience told me to pause.  
So, I checked the sender‚Äôs actual address:

> **techrely99admin@prizemons.com**

Not even close to legitimate.

Trusting my instincts, I reported the email using Outlook‚Äôs "Report Message" button. Moments later, I received confirmation:

![Phishing report confirmation](/root-logs/assets/images/phishing-report-confirmation.png)

It turned out this was part of an internal phishing simulation at William & Mary.  
The follow-up message reminded me that **91% of cyber-attacks start with phishing**, and catching these threats early plays a critical role in protecting not just ourselves, but our entire organization.

But I didn‚Äôt stop there.

## From Inbox to Investigation: Deepening My Understanding with TryHackMe

Encouraged by catching this phishing attempt, I decided to keep going.  
I had been working through TryHackMe‚Äôs **SOC Level 1** pathway, and it felt like the perfect opportunity to build on this experience.

In the room on **Phishing Prevention**, the training walked through how defenders can go beyond just reporting suspicious emails. It covered essential strategies like:
- Setting up **SPF, DKIM, and DMARC** records to protect domains.
- Using **spam filters** and **email sandboxing** for attachments.
- Running **internal phishing simulations** (like the one I experienced).
- Leveraging **security awareness training** to empower every user.

What struck me is how all these layers work together.  
Basic vigilance catches many threats, but **email security technologies** catch what human eyes might miss ‚Äî and vice versa.

The SOC Level 1 training helped me connect the dots between everyday email hygiene and the larger defense strategies used by Security Operations Centers (SOCs). I saw how analysts not only detect and report phishing but also investigate and neutralize these attacks with technical precision.

I realized: **reporting phishing is step one. Understanding why it works, and how to defend against it systematically, is step two.**

This post is my way of sharing what I learned from both experiences.

## ‚úâÔ∏è SPF vs. DKIM: Who's Protecting What?

When you think about protecting emails, you might imagine spam filters or antivirus. But email security begins *before* messages hit your inbox.

### ‚úÖ SPF: Sender Policy Framework

SPF is like your domain‚Äôs bouncer list.

It tells mail servers, **‚ÄúHere are the legitimate IP addresses allowed to send mail from my domain.‚Äù**

Example SPF record:
v=spf1 ip4:192.168.1.1 include:_spf.google.com -all


‚û°Ô∏è **SPF checks the sender‚Äôs mail server, not the email content.**

### ‚úÖ DKIM: DomainKeys Identified Mail

DKIM is about making sure the message **hasn‚Äôt been tampered with**.

It attaches a cryptographic signature to the email, and the recipient checks this against a public key published in DNS.

Example DKIM record:
v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=<public_key>


‚û°Ô∏è **DKIM focuses on integrity and authenticity of the message.**

---

## üõ°Ô∏è DMARC: The Enforcer

If SPF and DKIM are the guards, **DMARC** is the policy manager.

It tells mail servers what to do if an email fails authentication ‚Äî and sends reports so you know who‚Äôs trying to impersonate your domain.

Example DMARC record:
v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:security@domain.com


‚û°Ô∏è **DMARC ties SPF and DKIM together, adds enforcement, and provides visibility.**

---

## üîí S/MIME: Securing the Conversation

While SPF, DKIM, and DMARC work at the delivery level, **S/MIME** (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) protects the *content* of your emails.

S/MIME ensures:
- **Confidentiality** (encryption)
- **Integrity and authenticity** (digital signature)

Using public-key cryptography, S/MIME encrypts emails and verifies the sender‚Äôs identity.

‚û°Ô∏è **S/MIME is crucial for sensitive communications within organizations.**

## üïµÔ∏è Wireshark: Peering Into Email Traffic

The SOC Level 1 room also covered traffic analysis ‚Äî and it made me appreciate **Wireshark** even more.

### üéØ Filter SMTP Status Codes:
smtp.response.code

This helps you spot:
- **220**: Service ready
- **354**: Start mail input
- **550**: Mailbox unavailable

### üß© Source vs. Destination Ports Explained

| | Sender (Client) | Receiver (Server) |
|---|---|---|
| **Source Port** | Random high port (e.g., 51000) | Typically port 25 (SMTP) |
| **Destination Port** | Port 25 (SMTP standard) | Sender‚Äôs random port |

‚û°Ô∏è **If traffic is headed to port 25, it‚Äôs likely email outbound.  
If it‚Äôs coming *from* port 25, it‚Äôs likely a server response.**

Understanding this helped me see how attackers might use normal-looking email traffic to hide their malicious communications.

## üö® Adversaries Use Email for Command and Control (C2)

One eye-opening part of the SOC Level 1 training was learning about how attackers **abuse email protocols for C2** communications.

According to MITRE ATT&CK‚Äôs technique **T1071.003**, attackers use protocols like SMTP and POP3 to:
- Send commands to infected systems
- Exfiltrate stolen data
- Blend in with normal email traffic

Real-world example: **Zebrocy malware** ‚Äî it communicates via email protocols to evade detection.

### Defense Tips:
- Use **intrusion detection systems (IDS)** to monitor traffic patterns.
- Investigate unusual SMTP or POP3 flows.
- Block suspicious IPs and domains via **threat intelligence feeds**.

‚û°Ô∏è **Phishing prevention isn‚Äôt just about spam filters. It‚Äôs about spotting attackers using legitimate protocols for malicious goals.**

## üß∞ Building a Resilient Email Security Stack

Here's my current toolkit for defending against phishing and email-based attacks, inspired by the THM room experiences.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| SPF, DKIM, DMARC | Email authentication & enforcement |
| S/MIME | Secure sensitive communications |
| Wireshark | Deep traffic analysis |
| Spamhaus, Talos | Reputation-based blocking |
| Any.Run, VirusTotal | Analyzing suspicious attachments |
| Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) | Detect stealthy C2 communications |

## Final Thoughts

What started as a simple phishing simulation turned into a deep exploration of the systems that protect our inboxes every day.

Catching that fake voicemail email felt like a small victory ‚Äî but understanding **why it worked**, and how defenders respond to these threats at scale, was even more powerful.

From SPF to S/MIME, from network packet analysis to attacker C2 tactics, every layer of email security plays a role. And as defenders, it‚Äôs our job to know how they work ‚Äî not just rely on tools, but understand the "why" behind them.

If this post sparked your curiosity, stay tuned! I‚Äôll be sharing more soon:
- Building custom Wireshark filters for threat hunting
- Automating SPF/DKIM/DMARC checks
- Crafting a phishing incident response playbook

Until then ‚Äî stay curious, stay cautious, and don‚Äôt stop learning.
